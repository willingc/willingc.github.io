There are wonderful resources out there to help a new coder get started: Python documentation, PyLadies, Python User Groups, books and tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly have enjoyed my journey through learning Python. I love the language and its clarity. One of the things that has been challenging as I learned was understanding how to set up my development computers. The mystery of packages, pip, easy_install, venv, macports, brew, and a gobbledy goop of others kept me a little fuzzy every step of the way. Was my computer set up how it should be? Will I mess everything up if I pip instead of easy_install?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I haven't had any major catastrophes like smoke coming from my Macbook. Actually, the more that I learned about Python and used Python the jargon became less scary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, there are different ways to set up your development environment. For now, I am following the suggestions at Justin Mayer's Hacker Codex site. He does a very good job of clearly explaining how to set up a Mac for development and for Python development.

&lt;p&gt;When you are done setting up your Mac, you might want to watch his tutorial on setting up a website and blog using Pelican. It's very helpful.
